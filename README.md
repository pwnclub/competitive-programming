# Competitive Programming Solutions

A collection of my solutions to various programming problems (currently 100+). These come from a variety of programming contests, including the following:

* CCC (Canadian Computing Competition)
* CCO (Candian Computing Olympiad)
* ECOO (Educational Computing Organization of Ontario)
* ACM NAQ/ECNA (ACM North American Qualifier/
* IOI (International Olympiads of Informatics)
* DMOCP (Don Mills Open Programming Contest)
* THICC (Toronto Hackers Informatics Computing Competition)
* GCJ (Google Code Jam)
* COCI (Croatian Open Competition in Informatics)

# DMOJ

The majority of problems I solved on [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/), an online judge and contest platform. I have opted to organize them by point value. In general (along with a competition with approximate equivalence in problem difficulty):

* 3/4 Points → Very Easy (CCC Junior)
* 5/7 Points → Easy (CCC Junior/CCC Senior)
* 10/12 Points → Normal (CCC Senior)
* 15/20 Points → Hard (CCO)
* 25/30 Points → Very Hard (IOI)
* 35+ Points → Insane (Hard IOI/ACM-ICPC Problems)

The first four lines of my solutions indicate the following:

```
// Problem Title
// URL of problem's page
// Date of first correct submission
// Fastest running time achieved
```
